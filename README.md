# OpenSuspect

*One amongst us is not like the rest*<br/>
OpenSuspect is an open source online social deduction game, like mafia.<br/>
OpenSuspect aims to be easily modifiable, however, our first maps and themes are going to be focused around the cold war.<br/>
It uses the [`Godot Engine`](https://godotengine.org/).<br/>
This project is in *very early stage* development. However, see [this](https://github.com/opensuspect/opensuspect/wiki/Playtesting) guide for early playtesting.<br/>
Interested to get involved? We'd love to hear from you. Check out the [contributors guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get involved.<br/>

## About the project
The OpenSuspect project is a team endevour of many volunteers. Our members work on the project in their spare time, often after work or school, so we don't have a rushed development schedule. Many of us regard the project as valuable experience in not just software development but also in team work. Our most important goals during development:
* Supportive community
* Openness
* Keeping extensibiliy in mind
* Focus on learning

However, we also understand that a game needs a direction, and some problems are easiest to solve in a top-down fashion. Therefore, we agreed to implement a team structure, where each team have their responsibilities, and are organized by an elected team leader. The project is guided by the council containing the team leaders and a few elected project coordinators, who set the goals together. For the current teams and leadership, check the CONTRIBUTORS file.

## About the game
The main aims of the game:
* Give a very flexible backbone for social deduction games, allow for great variety in future maps, mods and playtiles
* Encourage collaborative gameplay that is equally fun for each participant
* Chat integration and flexible chat rules to fit various needs
* Free Software, Open Source, as all things should be

For the management of the development, we have 3 milestones that we are tracking on GitHub, see the [Milestones](https://github.com/opensuspect/opensus/milestones) page for current progress.
